Hospital Management System (HMS) is a software solution that helps streamline various administrative and operational tasks within a hospital or healthcare facility. It facilitates efficient management of patient information, appointments, billing, and other related tasks. Let's break down the components and functionalities of an HMS using the provided code as an example.

1. Patient Class:
   - The `Patient` class represents individual patients within the hospital system.
   - Attributes:
     - `name`: Name of the patient.
     - `age`: Age of the patient.
     - `gender`: Gender of the patient.
     - `diagnosis`: Diagnosis or medical condition of the patient.
   - Methods:
     - Constructor: Initializes the patient object with provided details.
     - Getter and setter methods: Allows access to and modification of patient attributes.

2. HospitalManagementSystem Class:
   - The `HospitalManagementSystem` class manages patient data and provides functionalities to interact with it.
   - Attributes:
     - `patients`: A collection (vector) of `Patient` objects.
   - Methods:
     - `addPatient`: Adds a new patient to the system with provided details.
     - `displayPatients`: Displays information about all patients currently in the system.

3. Main Function:
   - In the `main` function, an instance of `HospitalManagementSystem` is created.
   - Patients are added to the system using the `addPatient` method.
   - Patient information is displayed using the `displayPatients` method.

The provided code serves as a basic demonstration of how an HMS might function. It allows adding patients with their details and displaying the information of all patients currently in the system. However, in a real-world scenario, an HMS would typically include additional functionalities such as:

- Appointment Management: Allowing patients to schedule appointments with doctors.
- Billing System: Generating bills for services provided to patients.
- Doctor and Staff Management: Managing information about doctors and hospital staff.
- Inventory Management: Tracking and managing medical supplies and equipment.
- Reporting and Analytics: Generating reports on hospital performance, patient demographics, etc.
- Security and Access Control: Ensuring data privacy and restricting access to sensitive information.
- Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR): Connecting with electronic health record systems to access patient medical histories and treatment plans.

To enhance user experience and efficiency, a graphical user interface (GUI) can be implemented to provide an intuitive interface for hospital staff to interact with the system. Additionally, the code can be modularized further to improve maintainability and scalability. Each functionality (e.g., patient management, appointment scheduling) can be encapsulated within its own class or module, following principles of object-oriented design and modular programming.
